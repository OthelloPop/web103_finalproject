## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

The Pitch Day was successful. We received helpful feedback from the instructor, TF, and peers that our project scope was attainable and practice course concepts well.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We have not faced significant challenges yet. This week mostly involved planning for milestones and feature development.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We were able to set up the database with different tables, but were unable to begin local environment development. This will be the first task prioritized for next week.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

There are no features at risk right now. The harder features such as allowing users to save movies to a personal collection of the profile will be one of the last user stories we develop, so the limited amount of time may make it "at risk" in the future. If it becomes at risk, we will evaluate if the feature is neccessary of what changes we can implement instead to make it attainable by Demo Day.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

No additional support is needed at this time, but there may be significant technical issues or the inability to finish a feature in the future. If that is the case, we will reach out for support with Tech Fellows.
