## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

The creation of the project and the delineation of tasks.


### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Implementation of admin features, which include CRUD for movies.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We did, although the admin view lacks a visually pleasing interface. That will be the first thing prioritized next week, which should not take long.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The complex search will be difficult, there are many attributes of movies that can be searched for. Our plan if we face too many difficulties includes reducing the search complexities to search by movie title, director name, or genre.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Perhaps page management, authentication if we choose to pursue it, and the use of the join table of our user collection displays.
