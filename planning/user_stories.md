2. As a user, I would like to filter movie and TV show results based on attributes, such as title, genre, director, actor, or streaming service, so that I can narrow down and personalize my display.
3. As a user, I would like to save select movies and TV shows to my profile, so that I may refer back to them later.
4. As a user, I would like view my search history in my profile, so that I may remember earlier ideas for potential movies of interest.
